import { createContext } from "react";


export const LoginContext = createContext(null)
    // This line creates a new context named LoginContext using the createContext function. 

    // The initial value of the context is set to null, 
    // meaning that if no provider is wrapping the components consuming this 
    // context, they will receive null as the context value.


// createContext function that is imported from react is used to manage global login state


//createContext function from React is used to create a context object.


//with context, you dont have to pass props, so you can pass data into components without the need for props
